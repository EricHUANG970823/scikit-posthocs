===============

**scikit-posthocs** is a Python package which provides post hoc tests for
pairwise multiple comparisons that are usually performed in statistical data
analysis to assess the differences between group levels if a statistically
significant result of ANOVA test has been obtained.

**scikit-posthocs** is tightly integrated with Pandas DataFrames and NumPy
arrays to ensure fast computations and convenient data import and storage.

This package will be useful for statisticians, data analysts, and researchers
who use Python in their work.
